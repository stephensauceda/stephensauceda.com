[House Tours](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/house-tours) have long been the "bread and butter" of Apartment Therapy content. In early 2023, we wanted to revamp the way we present them to users in a more immersive experience.

Working with the Director of Product Design, and the mockups he created, we created a new full-screen experience for our House Tour galleries. The gallery was heavily influenced (in functionality) by Instagram Stories, so I had the opportunity to, sort of, reverse engineer the experience with our own flare.

Some interesting challenges with the gallery were injecting ads between slides (for mobile only) as well as implementing an end slide who's purpose was to entice and push users to the next tour to increase our pages per session metric.

So far, it seems to be working as pages per session is up about 33% and our session duration is up 37%.
